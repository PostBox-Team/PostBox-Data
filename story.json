    "content": "# Cydia\n**by Jay Freeman (Saurik)**\n\nBeing one of the oldest package managers, it is also one of the most used. It comes shipped with Unc0ver, Electra & Checkra1n. Due to its old age, it is really slow & it hasn't received any performance updates in the last few years. However, many Tweaks try to enhance its features, like [Flame](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.aditkamath.flame/) & [Pheromone](https://repo.packix.com/package/ws.hbang.pheromone). Cydia also no longer supports paid packages.\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Nostalgia\n- [x] Widely supported\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] Slow\n- [ ] Free Packages only\n- [ ] Enhancing Tweaks\n- [ ] No Native Depictions\n\n# Sileo\n**by Coolstar**\n\nA modern package manager developed by Coolstar for his Electra jailbreak. It gets shipped with Electra, Chimera, Odyssey & OdysseyRa1n. It introduces the new Native Depictions for a better user experience. Additionally, you can purchase & download paid packages using the new payment API.\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Widely supported\n- [x] Native Depictions\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Free Demo for non-jailbroken Devices\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] Complicated Installation for Checkra1n & Unc0ver Users\n\n# Zebra\n**by Wilson Styres & Andrew Abosh**\n\nA popular third-party package manager, which can easily be installed alongside Cydia/Sileo. It is fast as it processes Sources parallelly. It is designed to be installed as an additional package manager & it doesn't ship natively with any jailbreak. Zebra has refused to add native depictions for the longest time. In the new 1.2 version, it adds support for native depictions, though it doesn't support advertisements & repositories have to explicitly enable native depictions for Zebra.\n\nRepository: https://getzbra.com/repo/\nBeta: https://getzbra.com/beta/\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] No Native Depictions for most Repositories\n\n# Installer 5\n**by AppTapp**\n\nYet another third-party package manager. Installer has a unique design, looking more like the Apple Appstore than a regular package manager. The design requires some time to get used to, but the package manager has all the features a modern package manager needs. For example, it allows wishlisting tweaks & following developers. Installer parses depictions to make depictions look consistent & make them fit the general style of Installer.\n\nRepository: https://apptapp.me/repo/\nBeta: https://beta.apptapp.me/\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n- [x] Unique Design\n- [x] Automatic Native Depictions\n\n# Saily\n**by Lakr233 & Brecken Lusk**\n\nLast but not least, Saily, a modern package manager, which is not very well known. It is mainly for its RootlessJB support, though you can use it with jailbreak. Saily has a special feature, which allows you to send random device info to repositories, to prevent them from tracking you. It supports both paid packages & native depictions. It can be installed on any jailbreak together with Cydia/Sileo.\n\nDeb Download: https://github.com/SailyTeam/Saily/releases\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Incognito Mode\n- [x] Native Depictions\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] iOS 13+ only",

Well, it is just what they sound like, you can write articles and submit to PostBox! You can find more information regarding PostBox Stories next to the Settings icon.\n\nBut that is not the point of this story.\n\nWe need more stories, with this one being our one and only custom content present on the home page, our feed seems very lacking â€“ the exact reason why we built PostBox, to add a little bit of flavor to the jailbreak community.\n\nAnyone can join and contribute to PostBox. As our community grows, we are planning to bring more fun features to improve your in-app experience.",
