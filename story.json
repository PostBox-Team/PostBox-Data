    "content": "## Crane\n**by Lars Fr√∂der (opa334)**\n\nYou know the issue, you are so popular that you have two accounts on the same platform. Wait, you don't? Well me neither, but we can believe in our dreams and maybe someday they will come true.\n\nSo if, for whatever reason it may be, you have two accounts, but it is annoying to switch between them because you have to sign out and enter the credentials for your second account. Most modern applications support multiple accounts, like Gmail or Outlook, but there are still numerous apps that don't. And this is where Crane saves the day. With Crane, you have the ability to install an app 'twice'. So you could have an instance where you're signed in with your main account and a second, where you're signed in to your second account.\n\nThis works by creating separate Containers for each instance, so each instance keeps its settings. And the main advantage of using Crane is that it also supports separate keychains, which, for those of you who don't know, is where the app stores your credentials.\n\nYou can conveniently switch between instances by 3D-touching on the app icon.\n\nNow there are some limits, the app store for example cannot be duplicated as it is strictly tied to your device. And the major (and one of the only) downside with this tweak is that notifications only work on the currently active container.\n\n**Price:** $1.99  \n**Compatability:** iOS 11+  \n||repo:https://repo.packix.com||\n\n## Crane Lite\nCrane lite is free, therefore it offers a limited feature set and it limits you to only duplicate one application. This is not only useful to find out if you like the tweak, but it is actually an important feature so you can check if the app you're trying to duplicate works before buying the tweak.\n\nWhile Crane Lite may be enough for you, I recommend buying the tweak (if you can) to support the developer.",

The title may lead you to believe that the tweak has something to do with anime, however in this case it refers to \"Animate\".\n\nThere are a few options to adjust, such as the duration and the ability to blacklist apps. More interesting is the adaptive color option, as it allows the badges to have the same color as the app icon, as the name suggests. It uses a smart algorithm, which ignores extremely light and dark areas, so glyph-like icons don't have a black/white badge.\n\nNow to get to the interesting stuff, the animations. There are 11 of them in total.\n\n**1. Heart Beating**\n[![GIF](https://media2.giphy.com/media/pbry8zU9JTreFSRtIG/giphy.gif)](https://media2.giphy.com/media/pbry8zU9JTreFSRtIG/giphy.gif)\n\n**2.

However, H.265 comes with a licensing fee, which is likely the reason why YouTube hasn‚Äôt adopted the use of that codec. As a result, some people confuse H.265 as incapable of playing back 4k videos. This is not the case as YouTube only allows uploading videos with the VP9 codec, restricting Apple devices using H.265 from playing back 4k content.\n\nWhile iOS 13 and below does not support Youtube at 4k, there are some tweaks that enable that option. Made by developer [@iJulioVerne](https://twitter.com/iJulioVerne), YTHDUnlocker enables 1440p to 8k playback. A newer tweak, YTUHD SW, developed by [@PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart), makes 4k playback possible on Youtube. However, please take this paragraph as a grain of salt as some of these tweaks are deprecated on latest versions of Youtube. (As far as I know)\n\nMany of you may ask, iPhone screens do not have a resolution of 4k, why even bother installing these tweaks? However, it is proven that 4k videos look much clearer than 1080p, even on an iPhone 11 with a sub 1080p display. Such examples of downscaling can be found in video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V. If a player with a 1080p display sets the frame scaling to 200%, the game will render at 3840x2160 (4k) and downscales it to 1080p. The result is a higher quality game render.\n\nIn the end, if you want to have the maximum YouTube viewing experience possible, don‚Äôt hesitate to switch to 2160p if you have an iPhone 8 or above with iOS 14.",

However, many Tweaks try to enhance its features, like [Flame](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.aditkamath.flame) & [Pheromone](https://repo.packix.com/package/ws.hbang.pheromone).

It is fast as it processes sources parallelly. It is designed to be installed as an additional package manager and doesn't ship natively with any jailbreak. Zebra has refused to add native depictions for the longest time. In the new 1.2 version, it adds support for native depictions. Though it doesn't support advertisements and repositories have to explicitly enable native depictions for Zebra.\n\nRepository: [https://getzbra.com/repo](https://getzbra.com/repo)\n\nBeta: [https://getzbra.com/beta](https://getzbra.com/beta)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] No Native Depictions for most Repositories\n\n# Installer 5\n**by AppTapp**\n\nYet another third-party package manager. Installer has a unique design, looking more like the Apple Appstore than a regular package manager. The design requires some time to get used to, but the package manager has all the features a modern package manager needs. For example, it allows wishlisting tweaks & following developers. Installer parses depictions to make them look consistent and fit the general style of Installer.\n\nRepository: [https://apptapp.me/repo](https://apptapp.me/repo)\n\nBeta: [https://beta.apptapp.me](https://beta.apptapp.me)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n- [x] Unique Design\n- [x] Automatic Native Depictions\n\n# Saily\n**by Lakr233 and Brecken Lusk**\n\nLast but not least, Saily, a modern package manager, which is not very well known. It is mainly for its RootlessJB support, though you can use it with jailbreak. Saily has a special feature, which allows you to send random device info to repositories, to prevent them from tracking you. It supports both paid packages and native depictions. It can be installed on any jailbreak together with Cydia/Sileo.\n\nDeb Download: [https://github.com/SailyTeam/Saily/releases](https://github.com/SailyTeam/Saily/releases)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Incognito Mode\n- [x] Native Depictions\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] iOS 13+ only",
