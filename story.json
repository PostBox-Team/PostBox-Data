        "dateCreated": "5.31.21",
        "datePublished": "5.31.21",
        "content": "**Snowboard and Neonboard** both serve the same general purpose, which is to theme your device. This goes from theming your Home Screen icons (and giving them masks) to theming the status bar and control center icons to theming the respring logo. Pretty much every image/icon can be changed. Now though, you need to choose, Snowboard or Neonboard? They both have pros and they both have cons, so there's no perfect answer. Hopefully, you'll be able to choose after reading the rest of this!\n\n## Better Battery Life? \nNeonboard is reported to have less battery life than Snowboard, and that's not too surprising. Neonboard does less than Snowboard, so with fewer hooks, it's sure to use less battery. It might also be better optimized than Snowboard, but the previous explanation probably contributes the most. My Experience: I don't think I had much of a difference between Snowboard and Neonboard battery-wise. I also switched jailbreaks when I originally switched to Neonboard though, so that could have played into it.\n\n## Better Stability?\nOverall, Neonboard tends to be more unstable than Snowboard. Sometimes, you'll have to clear the NeonCache because icons won't change or will just be all blank. Snowboard doesn't have as many problems as this, so that could be a win for you. If you want, you can use Neonboard to start, and then if you break it you can switch to Snowboard (after clearing the NeonCache just to make sure that you have to). Sometimes cleaning the NeonCache doesn't work though, so you won't have the best experience without switching. Snowboard, however, tends to make some icons too big or too small. To be clear, this only applies to UI Icons, not HS Icons. Some places suffer from this with Neonboard too, like in SwiftUI, but the status bar sometimes is only really buggy with Snowboard. \n\n**My Experience:** Neonboard worked well for me for a long while. However, I ran into enough problems to have to clean the NeonCahce twice, which did work out. I ended up installing a theme (SiriSpring) which just made the preferences for NeonBoard start crashing, so I switched to Snowboard so that I could use it for a little bit. I did also run into the weird sizes bug with Snowboard though, so I haven't themed status bar icons in a while. Also, Snowboard has been overlaying themed icons in my status bar instead of replacing the theme, so that's another reason why I haven't been using it.\n\n## More Features?\nSnowboard takes the win here. It's able to theme some things that Neonboard can't. It can also round and scale Home Screen icons (along with a couple of other things) but Neonboard can't do those either. Neonboard can do icon masks, but if you have a custom size and corner radius in mind, Neonboard won't be as easy to use. One last thing Snowboard can do that Neonboard can't: it can use your images as custom icons without you having to create a theme.\n\n## Are they Open Source?\nNeonboard is the only one of the two that is Open Source, you can find it on GitHub at [ArtikusHG/Neonboard](https://github.com/ArtikusHG/NeonBoard). You can go there to learn more about what Neonboard does (or learn from it for your own tweaks), contribute to it, and open an issue there if you find a problem. ArtikusHG usually fixes issues within a few days, so if you run into a problem, go there and open an issue.\n\n## So, which one should I choose?\nRead above, choose your priorities, whether it be battery life or features, then try one out. You can always switch, and pretty easily too, since Snowboard themes work with Neonboard and vice versa, you'll just have to reconfigure which themes to use. Once you've decided, go ahead and try it out for a couple of days and see what you think! Good luck with whatever you choose; hopefully it serves you well while theming your icons. Here's the repo and tweak links for both in case you can't find them:\n### Snowboard\n||repo:https://sparkdev.me||\n||package:Snowboard,com.spark.snowboard,https://sparkdev.me||\nNote: For Snowboard, you’ll need to download some of the extensions for full functionality.\n### Neonboard\n||repo:https://artikushg.github.io||\n||package:Neonboard,com.artikus.neonboard,https://artikushg.github.io||\nIf you don’t need all the features of Neonboard and want a lighter version, use Neonboard Lite:\n||package:Neonboard Lite,com.artikus.neonboard-lite,https://artikushg.github.io||",

Well me neither, but we can believe in our dreams and maybe someday they will come true.\n\nSo if, for whatever reason it may be, you have two accounts, but it is annoying to switch between them because you have to sign out and enter the credentials for your second account. Most modern applications support multiple accounts, like Gmail or Outlook, but there are still numerous apps that don't. And this is where Crane saves the day. With Crane, you have the ability to install an app 'twice'. So you could have an instance where you're signed in with your main account and a second, where you're signed in to your second account.\n\nThis works by creating separate Containers for each instance, so each instance keeps its settings. And the main advantage of using Crane is that it also supports separate keychains, which, for those of you who don't know, is where the app stores your credentials.\n\nYou can conveniently switch between instances by 3D-touching on the app icon.\n\nNow there are some limits, the app store for example cannot be duplicated as it is strictly tied to your device. And the major (and one of the only) downside with this tweak is that notifications only work on the currently active container.\n\n**Price:** $1.99  \n**Compatability:** iOS 11+  \n||repo:https://repo.packix.com||\n\n## Crane Lite\nCrane lite is free, therefore it offers a limited feature set and it limits you to only duplicate one application. This is not only useful to find out if you like the tweak, but it is actually an important feature so you can check if the app you're trying to duplicate works before buying the tweak.\n\nWhile Crane Lite may be enough for you, I recommend buying the tweak (if you can) to support the developer.",

AnimateMyBadges attempts to change that, while still making them look like badges. The title may lead you to believe that the tweak has something to do with anime, however in this case it refers to \"Animate\".\n\nThere are a few options to adjust, such as the duration and the ability to blacklist apps. More interesting is the adaptive color option, as it allows the badges to have the same color as the app icon, as the name suggests. It uses a smart algorithm, which ignores extremely light and dark areas, so glyph-like icons don't have a black/white badge.\n\nNow to get to the interesting stuff, the animations. There are 11 of them in total.\n\n**1. Heart Beating**\n[![GIF](https://media2.giphy.com/media/pbry8zU9JTreFSRtIG/giphy.gif)](https://media2.giphy.com/media/pbry8zU9JTreFSRtIG/giphy.gif)\n\n**2.

        "content": "**Since the introduction** of iOS 14, Apple has enabled VP9 support in the native YouTube app. Previously, the standard video codec for Apple devices was H.265, while YouTube has been using VP9 for streaming videos with 4k resolution or higher.\n\nAs a comparison, H.265 is newer and more efficient than Google’s VP9 codec. However, H.265 comes with a licensing fee, which is likely the reason why YouTube hasn’t adopted the use of that codec. As a result, some people confuse H.265 as incapable of playing back 4k videos. This is not the case as YouTube only allows uploading videos with the VP9 codec, restricting Apple devices using H.265 from playing back 4k content.\n\nWhile iOS 13 and below does not support Youtube at 4k, there are some tweaks that enable that option. Made by developer [@iJulioVerne](https://twitter.com/iJulioVerne), YTHDUnlocker enables 1440p to 8k playback. A newer tweak, YTUHD SW, developed by [@PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart), makes 4k playback possible on Youtube. However, please take this paragraph as a grain of salt as some of these tweaks are deprecated on latest versions of Youtube. (As far as I know)\n\nMany of you may ask, iPhone screens do not have a resolution of 4k, why even bother installing these tweaks? However, it is proven that 4k videos look much clearer than 1080p, even on an iPhone 11 with a sub 1080p display. Such examples of downscaling can be found in video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V. If a player with a 1080p display sets the frame scaling to 200%, the game will render at 3840x2160 (4k) and downscales it to 1080p. The result is a higher quality game render.\n\nIn the end, if you want to have the maximum YouTube viewing experience possible, don’t hesitate to switch to 2160p if you have an iPhone 8 or above with iOS 14.",

        "content": "# Cydia\n**by Jay Freeman (Saurik)**\n\nBeing one of the oldest package managers, it is also one of the most used. It comes shipped with Unc0ver, Electra, and Checkra1n. Due to its old age, it is really slow and it hasn't received any performance updates in the last few years. However, many Tweaks try to enhance its features, like [Flame](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.aditkamath.flame) & [Pheromone](https://repo.packix.com/package/ws.hbang.pheromone). Cydia also no longer supports paid packages.\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Enhancing Tweaks\n- [x] Nostalgia\n- [x] Widely supported\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] Slow\n- [ ] Free Packages only\n- [ ] No Native Depictions\n\n# Sileo\n\n**by Coolstar**\n\nA modern package manager developed by Coolstar for their Electra jailbreak. It gets shipped with Electra, Chimera, Odyssey, and OdysseyRa1n. It introduces the new Native Depictions for a better user experience. Additionally, you can purchase & download paid packages using the new payment API.\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Widely supported\n- [x] Native Depictions\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Free Demo for non-jailbroken Devices\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] Complicated Installation for Checkra1n and Unc0ver Users\n\n# Zebra\n\n**by Wilson Styres and Andrew Abosh**\n\nA popular third-party package manager, which can easily be installed alongside Cydia/Sileo. It is fast as it processes sources parallelly. It is designed to be installed as an additional package manager and doesn't ship natively with any jailbreak. Zebra has refused to add native depictions for the longest time. In the new 1.2 version, it adds support for native depictions. Though it doesn't support advertisements and repositories have to explicitly enable native depictions for Zebra.\n\nRepository: [https://getzbra.com/repo](https://getzbra.com/repo)\n\nBeta: [https://getzbra.com/beta](https://getzbra.com/beta)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] No Native Depictions for most Repositories\n\n# Installer 5\n**by AppTapp**\n\nYet another third-party package manager. Installer has a unique design, looking more like the Apple Appstore than a regular package manager. The design requires some time to get used to, but the package manager has all the features a modern package manager needs. For example, it allows wishlisting tweaks & following developers. Installer parses depictions to make them look consistent and fit the general style of Installer.\n\nRepository: [https://apptapp.me/repo](https://apptapp.me/repo)\n\nBeta: [https://beta.apptapp.me](https://beta.apptapp.me)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Easy Installation\n- [x] Unique Design\n- [x] Automatic Native Depictions\n\n# Saily\n\n**by Lakr233 and Brecken Lusk**\n\nLast but not least, Saily, a modern package manager, which is not very well known. It is mainly for its RootlessJB support, though you can use it with jailbreak. Saily has a special feature, which allows you to send random device info to repositories, to prevent them from tracking you. It supports both paid packages and native depictions. It can be installed on any jailbreak together with Cydia/Sileo.\n\nDeb Download: [https://github.com/SailyTeam/Saily/releases](https://github.com/SailyTeam/Saily/releases)\n\n**Advantages**\n- [x] Fast\n- [x] Paid Packages\n- [x] Incognito Mode\n- [x] Native Depictions\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- [ ] iOS 13+ only",
