Well, it is just what they sound like, you can write articles and submit to PostBox! You can find more information regarding PostBox Stories next to the Settings icon.\n\nBut that is not the point of this story.\n\nWe need more stories, with this one being our one and only custom content present on the home page, our feed seems very lacking â€“ the exact reason why we built PostBox, to add a little bit of flavor to the jailbreak community.\n\nAnyone can join and contribute to PostBox. As our community grows, we are planning to bring more fun features to improve your in-app experience.",
